## QuestDB Public Product Roadmap

Our [public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/questdb/projects/1/views/5) is where we communicate our development goals and gather feedback on ideas and features. We'd love to encourage our community members to comment on the roadmap items so we can take your feedback into consideration.

### Structure

- We use [this GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/questdb/projects/1/views/5) to present the public roadmap.
- The roadmap items are **major features or improvements** presented in GitHub issues, with a short summary and expected outcome.
- The timeline is structured by **quarters** to show the approximate time of delivery.
- **The roadmap is subject to change**, especially the items further out on the timeline. You'll also find a **Future** column, which is used when no concrete timeline is available.
- The roadmap items are organized with labels:
  - `open source`: the feature will only be available for open source QuestDB.
  - `questdb cloud`: the feature will only be available for QuestDB Cloud.
  - `enterprise`: the feature will be available in the enterprise version.
  - `idea`: features that are under consideration and require more feedback from the community.

This roadmap takes inspiration from [the official GitHub public product roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap). A huge thank you to the team who worked on that for paving the way!
